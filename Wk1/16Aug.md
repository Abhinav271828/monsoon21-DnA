# Database Systems
*Data* is factual (undoubted) information that can be recorded and have implicit meaning. There are three important parts of data: its creator, its believability and its semantics (or meaning).  

A *database* is a collection of related data. Its properties are:

* it represents some aspect of the real world (universe of discourse)
* it is logically coherent
* it has a specific purpose
* it has an intended group of users and some preconceived application.

A *database management system* (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain databases. The database along with a DBMS software is called a *database system*.
